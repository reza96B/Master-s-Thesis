\caption*{The figure presents estimation results of the model in Eqs.(\ref{asset}), (\ref{cross}) and (\ref{delta_t}) examining the cross-sectional relation between six-factor alphas and all characteristics simultaneously. In each plot we report posterior results for a given characteristic across our sample period February 2001 to December 2016. The solid line is the posterior mean of $\delta_t$ and the dashed lines represent the 95\% credible interval.}

\caption*{This figure presents the cumulative post-ranking Fama-French six-factor alpha for top-minus-bottom portfolios sorted on one of the following performance measures: six-factor alpha ($\alpha$), double-adjusted six-factor alpha ($\alpha^*$), or characteristic-driven performance ($\alpha^{char}$). These performance measures are calculated using rolling windows with a window size of 24 months. Portfolios are rebalanced every quarter-end and held up to 40 quarters. The horizontal axis shows the post-ranking holding period in quarters.}
